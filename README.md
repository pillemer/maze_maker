# Maze Maker
Depth-first search maze generation algorithm implemented using backtracking.

You can read about the algorithm on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm).

a grid is created and then the algorithm starts the maze at the top left corner of the grid.

### TODO:
- Add colour to nose
- add colour to backtracked / finished route
- trace solution
- allow selection of grid size and cell size
